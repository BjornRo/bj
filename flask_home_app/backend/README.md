Try to implement a "SMART HOME" system with a corresponding app.

Goal is to learn full-stack and use embedded devices around the home to get data.
I'm using MQTT protocol to get data to a central device in the home, but
most of the time you're lazy and don't want to get up and look at that device.

To solve this, make a pretty website. Maybe implement a database to log temperature/humidity, this data
could be fun analyzing with the respect of time.
