Try to implement a "SMART HOME" system with a corresponding app.

Goal is to learn full-stack and use embedded devices around the home to get data.
I'm using MQTT protocol to get data to a central device in the home, but
most of the time you're lazy and don't want to get up and look at that device.

To solve this, make a pretty website. Maybe implement a database to log temperature/humidity, this data
could be fun analyzing with the respect of time.

Inspiration taken from Tech with Tim youtube tutorial. Mostly to get started with js and general structure.


For the curious. DB doesn't store any sensitive data. If you like to learn how to query a .db file
and then do some datascience, go ahead!
